## What is Squid Router

Squid is a liquidity and messaging router built on the Axelar Network that enables seamless token transfers between different blockchains. This cross-chain swap widget allows you to:

- Swap tokens between different blockchains in a single transaction
- Access the entire crypto ecosystem through universal Web3 interoperability
- Build fast, secure cross-chain functionality into DeFi applications
- Benefit from Axelar's proof-of-stake consensus and permissionless protocols

In this guide, we'll demonstrate transferring USDC tokens from Ethereum to Cosmos, converting them into ATOM tokens.

## Before You Begin

**Requirements:**
- MetaMask wallet with USDC on Ethereum
- Keplr wallet for Cosmos transactions
- Sufficient ETH for gas fees
- Basic understanding of cross-chain transfers

**Important Notes:**
- Cross-chain transfers can take several minutes to complete
- Always verify recipient addresses before confirming transactions
- Keep some native tokens for gas fees on both chains
