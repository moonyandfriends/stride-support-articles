## Overview

The stOSMO/OSMO liquidity pool offers unique advantages compared to traditional Osmosis pools. This guide walks you through providing liquidity to Pool #833 with high yields and no impermanent loss risk.

---

## Why stOSMO Pool is Special

### No Impermanent Loss
- Traditional Osmosis pools suffer from impermanent loss
- The stOSMO/OSMO pool maintains 100% OSMO exposure
- Functions like staking OSMO but with much higher yields

### Superior Yields
- **OSMO staking yield:** ~23% APR
- **stOSMO pool APR:** Currently over 200%!

### Beginner-Friendly
- Great entry point due to lack of impermanent loss
- High yield potential with lower complexity

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A Keplr wallet (see our [Keplr connection guide](how-to-connect-to-keplr-on-stride.md) if needed)
- A positive balance of OSMO tokens
- Some tokens for transaction fees

---

## Step 1: Convert OSMO to stOSMO

For this tutorial, convert half your OSMO to stOSMO so you have equal amounts for the liquidity pool.
