## Understanding Liquidity Pools

### What is a Liquidity Pool?
- A pool of digital tokens that enables trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
- Facilitates peer-to-peer trading by providing steady supply of buyers and sellers
- Ensures trades can be executed quickly and efficiently

### Why Osmosis?
- Largest DEX in the Cosmos ecosystem
- Stride's main liquidity hub
- Uses Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) for trustless transactions

---

## Osmosis Frontend Options

Osmosis operates two separate frontends:

### [App Page](https://app.osmosis.zone/)
- Used for all on-boarded chains
- Contains tokens registered on Osmosis Assetlist Registry
- Main frontend for established tokens

### [Frontier](https://frontier.osmosis.zone/)
- Space for newly listed and unverified tokens
- Multichain DEX for Cosmos-based tokens
- Access to liquidity pools, token swaps, and incentive generation

**Important:** Ensure you're using the correct frontend for your specific token and pool.
