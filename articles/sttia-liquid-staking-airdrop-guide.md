## What is stTIA

stTIA is the liquid staking token that represents staked TIA on Stride's platform. It provides users with:

- **Liquidity**: Use your staked TIA in DeFi while earning staking rewards
- **Flexibility**: Trade, lend, or provide liquidity without unstaking delays
- **Airdrop Eligibility**: Maintain eligibility for Celestia ecosystem airdrops
- **Rewards**: Earn both staking rewards and potential STRD airdrop tokens

**Celestia Integration:**
Stride collaborates directly with core Celestia teams to ensure stTIA maintains modularity, accountability, trustworthiness, and neutrality across the Celestia ecosystem.

## How to Liquid Stake TIA

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where do I need to hold my stTIA to be eligible?

stTIA must be held on Stride, Neutron, or Osmosis blockchain. It can also be held in Osmosis pool #1428 or the Astroport stTIA/TIA pool. Both stTIA and TIA in liquidity pools count toward eligibility. Additional whitelisted locations will be announced on the [Stride blog](https://www.stride.zone/blog/airdrop-to-sttia-holders).

### How often are snapshots taken?

Snapshots for the stTIA airdrop are taken daily at random times to maintain fairness and prevent system gaming. This ensures the STRD token allocation is based on varied stTIA holdings snapshots.

### How often do rewards update on the website?

Airdrop allocations are updated periodically following daily snapshots, but not in real-time. Update frequency and timing can vary. The [stTIA Airdrop dashboard](https://app.stride.zone/tia-airdrop) shows the date of the latest uploaded snapshot.

### Will stTIA holders be eligible for future airdrops?

Eligibility for airdrops is determined case-by-case. The Stride team ensures stToken holders, including stTIA holders, remain eligible for the same airdrops as native stakers. The team proactively engages with airdrop distributors, offering snapshot assistance and making snapshot information readily available.
