- **Write on paper** and store in secure physical locations

**Storage Best Practices:**
1. **Physical storage**:
   - Write clearly on paper
   - Use pencil or permanent ink

   - Make multiple copies

2. **Location security**:
   - Store in different physical locations
   - Use safe deposit boxes
   - Consider home safes
   - Avoid obvious locations

3. **Access control**:
   - Only you should know the location
   - Consider telling trusted family member for inheritance
   - Use tamper-evident storage
   - Regular physical checks

### Password Security

**Wallet Passwords:**

- **Trezor Model T**: Open source, good reputation
- **Keystone**: Air-gapped, QR code based

### Multi-Signature Security

**Benefits:**

- **Reduced risk**: No single point of failure
- **Business use**: Good for organizations
- **Inheritance planning**: Distribute access

**Implementation:**
- **2-of-3 setup**: Common configuration
