## Airdrop Overview

The Stride airdrop rewards early supporters and active participants in the Cosmos ecosystem with STRD tokens. To claim your airdrop, you must complete specific tasks that demonstrate engagement with the Stride protocol.

**Key Points:**
- No airdropped STRD is clawed back to the community pool
- You must manually claim your STRD within the specified time window
- Unclaimed tokens are redistributed to all original recipients
- Each airdrop has a limited claim window with clear deadlines
