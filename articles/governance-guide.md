## Introduction to Governance

### What is Blockchain Governance?

**Governance** is the process by which blockchain networks make decisions about protocol changes, upgrades, and community initiatives. It's how decentralized communities coordinate and evolve their protocols.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Decentralized decision-making**: No single authority controls the network
- **Community participation**: All stakeholders can contribute
- **Transparent process**: All proposals and votes are public
- **Binding decisions**: Governance results determine protocol changes

### Why Governance Matters

**For the Network:**
- **Protocol evolution**: Adapt to changing needs
- **Security updates**: Address vulnerabilities
- **Feature additions**: Add new capabilities
- **Economic adjustments**: Modify tokenomics

**For Users:**
- **Voice in decisions**: Influence protocol direction
- **Protect interests**: Ensure favorable outcomes
- **Community building**: Participate in ecosystem development
- **Value alignment**: Support values-driven development

## Stride Governance Overview

### Stride's Governance Model

**Dual Governance System:**
Stride operates with two layers of governance:

1. **Stride Chain Governance**
   - **STRD token voting**: Native governance token
   - **Protocol decisions**: Core Stride protocol changes
   - **Parameter adjustments**: Fee rates, operational settings
   - **Upgrades**: Major protocol upgrades

2. **Underlying Chain Governance**
   - **Liquid staking tokens**: Vote on underlying chains
   - **Validator selection**: Influence validator choices
   - **Chain upgrades**: Participate in host chain governance
   - **Cross-chain coordination**: Inter-chain governance

### Governance Participants

**STRD Token Holders:**
- **Direct voting**: Vote on Stride proposals
- **Proposal creation**: Submit governance proposals
- **Validator selection**: Choose Stride validators
- **Fee governance**: Decide on protocol fees

**Liquid Staking Token Holders:**
- **Underlying chain voting**: Vote on host chain proposals
- **Validator influence**: Indirect validator selection
- **Protocol representation**: Stride votes on your behalf
- **Liquid democracy**: Maintain liquidity while participating

### Governance Scope

**Stride Governance Covers:**
- **Protocol upgrades**: Major version updates
- **Parameter changes**: Fee rates, limits, timeouts
- **Asset additions**: New tokens for liquid staking
- **Security measures**: Emergency procedures
- **Community initiatives**: Grants, partnerships

**What Governance Doesn't Cover:**
- **Individual transactions**: Personal transaction decisions
- **Private keys**: Individual security matters
- **Market prices**: Token price determination
- **Third-party integrations**: External protocol decisions

## Voting with Liquid Staking Tokens

### How LST Voting Works

**Revolutionary Concept:**
Traditional staking requires choosing between earning rewards and participating in governance. Stride's liquid staking tokens allow you to do both simultaneously.

**Voting Mechanism:**
1. **Liquid staking tokens represent voting power**
2. **Stride aggregates votes** from LST holders
3. **Proportional representation** based on token holdings
4. **Automatic execution** of aggregate votes

### Voting Power Calculation

**Formula:**
Your voting power = (Your LST balance / Total LST supply) × Total staked tokens

**Example:**
- You hold 100 stATOM
- Total stATOM supply: 10,000
- Total ATOM staked via Stride: 1,000,000
- Your voting power: (100/10,000) × 1,000,000 = 10,000 ATOM

### Supported Governance

**Current LST Governance Support:**
- **stATOM**: Cosmos Hub governance
- **stOSMO**: Osmosis governance
- **stTIA**: Celestia governance
- **stDYM**: Dymension governance
- **stINJ**: Injective governance

*Note: Governance support continues to expand with new integrations*

### Voting Benefits

**Advantages of LST Voting:**
- **Maintain liquidity**: Use tokens while voting
- **Continuous participation**: No need to unstake
- **Proportional power**: Voting power scales with holdings
- **Simplified process**: Stride handles technical details
