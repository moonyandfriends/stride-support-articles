- Lower values indicate higher liquidation risk

**Borrowing Capacity:**
- Shows how much more you can borrow
- Based on the value of your supplied collateral
- Changes with market price movements

**Interest Rates:**
- Supply APY: Interest earned on supplied collateral
- Borrow APY: Interest paid on borrowed assets

## Risk Management

### Understanding Liquidation Risk

**Liquidation Threshold:**

- Monitor positions regularly
- Set up price alerts for your collateral assets
- Consider adding more collateral during market volatility

### Position Management Best Practices

**Regular Monitoring:**
- Check your health factor daily
- Watch for changes in borrowing capacity
- Monitor interest rate fluctuations

**Active Management:**
- Repay debt to improve health factor
- Add collateral to increase borrowing capacity
- Consider partial position closure during high volatility

**Emergency Procedures:**
- Know how to quickly add collateral
- Understand the repayment process
- Have a plan for market downturns
