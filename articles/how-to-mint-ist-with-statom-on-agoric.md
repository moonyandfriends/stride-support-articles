## Overview

Inter Protocol on Agoric now supports stATOM as collateral for minting IST, a decentralized stablecoin. This integration allows you to mint IST against your stATOM holdings while continuing to earn staking rewards on your ATOM assets.

**Key Milestone:** stATOM is only the second form of collateral to meet Inter Protocol's rigorous economic and risk standards, joining ATOM as an accepted asset.

- Over-collateralized positions subject to governed parameters
- Users lock collateral to mint corresponding amounts of IST

### Unique Advantages of stATOM
- Preserve staking rewards while minting stablecoins
- Continue earning ATOM staking yields on your collateral
- Maintain exposure to ATOM appreciation
