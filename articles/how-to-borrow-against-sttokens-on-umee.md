## Overview

Umee is a cross-chain money market that allows you to supply stAssets (like stATOM) as collateral and borrow other assets against them. This guide walks you through the complete process of borrowing against your stTokens on Umee.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- stAssets in your wallet (e.g., stATOM, stOSMO)
- Native Umee tokens for transaction fees (0.5 UMEE recommended minimum)
- A compatible wallet (Keplr recommended)
- Understanding of borrowing risks and liquidation mechanics

## Step 1: Prepare Your stAssets

### Withdraw from DeFi Protocols
If your stAssets are deployed in other DeFi protocols:

1. Visit [app.osmosis.zone/assets](https://app.osmosis.zone/assets)
2. Find your stAssets in the asset list
3. Click "Withdraw" next to each stAsset
4. Complete the withdrawal to move tokens back to your wallet

### Acquire UMEE Tokens
You'll need UMEE tokens for transaction fees:
- Purchase UMEE tokens on Osmosis or other supported exchanges
- Transfer UMEE to your wallet
- Ensure you have at least 0.5 UMEE for fees

## Step 3: Supply stAssets as Collateral

### Access the Market
1. Select your stAsset (e.g., stATOM) from the Umee market chart
2. Review the Supply and Borrow charts
3. Check market details and key metrics
4. Verify you have a positive wallet balance after the transfer

### Supply Process

## Step 4: Borrow Against Your Collateral

### Select Borrowing Asset
1. Choose the asset you want to borrow from the available market
2. You can borrow the same asset (e.g., borrow stATOM against stATOM collateral)
3. Or choose a different supported asset

### Borrowing Process
1. Click "Borrow" next to your chosen asset
2. Enter the amount you wish to borrow
3. **Critical:** Monitor these key metrics:
   - **Borrow Position:** Your total borrowed amount
   - **Supply Position:** Your total supplied collateral
   - **Borrow Limit Used:** Percentage of available borrowing power used

4. Click "Borrow" to proceed
5. Approve the transaction in your wallet

### Safety Considerations
- **Avoid approaching 100% borrow limit usage**
- **Leave buffer room to prevent liquidation**
- **Monitor your position regularly**

---

## Managing Your Position

### Dashboard Overview
After borrowing, your Umee dashboard will show:
- **Supply section:** Your stAsset collateral with outstanding balances
- **Borrow section:** Your borrowed assets with outstanding balances
- Real-time position health and utilization ratios

### Important Monitoring
1. **Borrow Limit:** Direct relationship to supplied collateral amount
2. **Liquidation Risk:** When borrowed amount approaches collateral value
3. **Interest Rates:** Both earning (supply) and paying (borrow)

### Position Management Actions
- **Add more collateral:** Increase borrow limit and improve position health
- **Repay debt:** Reduce borrow utilization and liquidation risk
- **Withdraw collateral:** Only possible if borrow limit allows
- **Borrow more:** Only if borrow limit permits additional borrowing
