1. This is for 'Connected Processing Services' - we need to update all references to the dashboard of 'Property to' and other to Connected Processing Services
2. On the Executive Dashboard: make the: Growth Metrics, Performance Targets, Risk Indicators, and Achievements to be the same size. Remove the squares in front of these too. Make sure all the information besides the headers in this table are aligned to the right. Right now: Churn Risk Accounts and Cost Reduction 8.2% are to the left.
3. Please space out the information on the Executive Dashboard more spaced out so there's less white space on the bottom.
