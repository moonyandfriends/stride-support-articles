## What is Liquid Staking?

**Liquid staking** is an innovative approach to blockchain staking that solves the traditional trade-off between earning staking rewards and maintaining liquidity of your assets.

### Traditional Staking vs. Liquid Staking

**Traditional Staking:**
- Your tokens are locked up for weeks/months
- You earn staking rewards but can't use your tokens
- Must wait through unbonding periods to access funds
- Miss out on DeFi opportunities

**Liquid Staking with Stride:**
- Your tokens remain "liquid" and usable
- You receive liquid staking tokens (LSTs) representing your stake
- Earn staking rewards while using LSTs in DeFi
- No waiting periods - sell LSTs anytime for instant liquidity

### Key Concept: Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)

When you liquid stake through Stride, you receive **liquid staking tokens** that:
- Represent your staked position 1:1
- Automatically accrue staking rewards
- Can be used across DeFi protocols
- Are redeemable for the underlying staked tokens

**Examples:**
- Stake ATOM → Receive stATOM
- Stake OSMO → Receive stOSMO
- Stake TIA → Receive stTIA

---

## Why Choose Liquid Staking?

### 1. **Maintain Liquidity**
- Use your staked tokens immediately in DeFi
- No long lockup periods
- Sell your position anytime if needed

### 2. **Earn Double Rewards**
- **Staking rewards**: Earn native staking yields
- **DeFi rewards**: Use LSTs in liquidity pools, lending, etc.
- **Compounding**: Rewards automatically compound

### 3. **Capital Efficiency**
- Don't choose between staking and DeFi - do both
- Maximize your token productivity
- Access to more opportunities

### 4. **Flexibility**
- Enter and exit positions easily
- Rebalance your portfolio without unbonding delays
- Participate in governance while earning DeFi yields

## How Stride Works

### The Stride Protocol

Stride is a **specialized blockchain** built on the Cosmos SDK that focuses exclusively on liquid staking. Here's how it works:

### 1. **Interchain Accounts**
- Stride uses Interchain Accounts (ICA) to stake on your behalf
- Your tokens are staked across multiple validators for security
- Stride manages the staking process automatically

### 2. **Validator Selection**
- Stride distributes stakes across multiple validators
- Reduces single-validator risk
- Ensures optimal reward rates

### 3. **Reward Distribution**
- Staking rewards accrue to your LSTs automatically
- 10% fee goes to Stride protocol
- 90% of rewards go to you
- Automatic compounding increases your holdings

### 4. **Redemption Mechanism**
- LSTs can always be redeemed for underlying staked tokens
- Market mechanisms keep LSTs close to 1:1 peg
- Arbitrage opportunities maintain price stability

## Understanding Your Rewards

### How Rewards Work

**Automatic Accrual:**
- Rewards are built into your LST balance
- Your LST value increases over time
- No need to manually claim rewards

**Example:**
- You stake 100 ATOM and receive 100 stATOM
- After 1 year with 10% staking rewards:
  - Your 100 stATOM is now worth ~109 ATOM
  - 9 ATOM went to you (90% of 10 ATOM rewards)
  - 1 ATOM went to Stride (10% fee)

### Viewing Your Rewards

**On Stride App:**
1. Visit [app.stride.zone](https://app.stride.zone)
2. Connect your wallet
3. View your staking positions and accrued rewards

**On Block Explorers:**
- Check your wallet address on relevant explorers
- See your LST balance increases over time

### Reward Rates

**Current approximate rates (subject to change):**
- stATOM: ~15-20% APR
- stOSMO: ~10-15% APR
- stTIA: ~12-18% APR
- stDYM: ~20-25% APR

*Note: Rates vary based on network conditions and validator performance*

## Using Your Liquid Staking Tokens

### DeFi Opportunities

Your LSTs can be used across the Cosmos ecosystem:

### 1. **Osmosis DEX**
- **Liquidity Pools**: Provide liquidity (e.g., ATOM/stATOM)
- **Superfluid Staking**: Earn LP + staking rewards
- **Trading**: Swap between different tokens

### 2. **Lending Protocols**
- **Collateral**: Use LSTs as collateral for loans
- **Lending**: Lend your LSTs to earn interest
- **Borrowing**: Borrow against your LST positions

### 3. **Yield Farming**
- **Liquidity Mining**: Earn additional tokens
- **Compound Strategies**: Stack multiple yield sources
- **Arbitrage**: Take advantage of price differences

### 4. **Other DEXs**
- **Crescent**: Trade and provide liquidity
- **Dexter**: Mars Protocol integration
- **Astroport**: Terra ecosystem opportunities

### Example Strategy: Double Rewards

1. **Stake ATOM** on Stride → Get stATOM
2. **Provide liquidity** on Osmosis (ATOM/stATOM pool)
3. **Earn rewards** from:
   - Staking rewards from stATOM
   - LP fees from providing liquidity
   - Potential OSMO rewards from liquidity mining

**Pros:**
- Immediate liquidity
- No waiting period
- Can be done anytime

**Cons:**
- May receive slightly less than 1:1 rate
- Depends on market conditions
- Trading fees apply

**How to:**
1. Go to a DEX like Osmosis
2. Swap your LSTs for the underlying token
3. Receive tokens immediately

### Option 2: Unstake Through Stride (Delayed)
**Pros:**
- Guaranteed 1:1 redemption rate
- No trading fees to Stride
- Official protocol method

**Cons:**
- Must wait through unbonding period
- Typically 21 days for ATOM
- No rewards during unbonding

**How to:**
1. Visit [app.stride.zone](https://app.stride.zone)
2. Select "Unstake" for your LSTs
3. Choose amount to unstake
4. Confirm transaction
5. Wait for unbonding period
6. Claim your tokens once ready

### Unbonding Periods by Token

| Token | Unbonding Period |
|-------|------------------|
| ATOM  | 21 days         |
| OSMO  | 14 days         |

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I lose my staked tokens?

**A:** Your principal is protected by the underlying blockchain security. However, like all DeFi protocols, there are smart contract risks that are mitigated through audits and testing.

### Q: What happens if Stride goes offline?

**A:** Your staked tokens remain secure on the underlying blockchains. Stride's design ensures your tokens are always recoverable even in extreme scenarios.

### Q: Can I stake tokens I'm already earning rewards on?

**A:** You can liquid stake any compatible tokens, but you'll need to unstake them first if they're currently staked elsewhere.

### Q: Are there minimum amounts to stake?

**A:** No minimums, but consider transaction fees. It's usually economical to stake at least a few dollars worth of tokens.

### Q: How often are rewards distributed?

**A:** Rewards accrue continuously and are reflected in your LST balance. The exchange rate improves over time rather than discrete reward distributions.

### Q: Can I stake from a hardware wallet?

**A:** Yes! Keplr and other wallets support hardware wallets like Ledger. This provides extra security for your staking positions.
